    <h3>My Start</h3>
    I started my jiu jitsu journey about six years ago as a white belt. I was doing a lot of Muay Thai and watching a lot of Mixed Martial Arts and so it started off as something to make me a more well rounded martial artist and mostly something to get me in shape.  Who knew it would turn into a life's obsession.  I consider it a part of my lifestyle as it has blended into many parts of my life and self.  I have gotten healthier and stronger, gained many friendships, and have had a found a creative outlet as result of doing jiu jitsu.  Hopefully I could convince you to give it a try.  I really believe jiu jitsu is for everyone.

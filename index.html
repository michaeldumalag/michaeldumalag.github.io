    <h3>My Start</h3>
    I started my jiu jitsu journey about six years ago as a white belt. I was doing a lot of Muay Thai and watching a lot of Mixed Martial Arts and so it started off as something to make me a more well rounded martial artist and mostly something to get me in shape.  Who knew it would turn into a life's obsession.  I consider it a part of my lifestyle as it has blended into many parts of my life and self.  I have gotten healthier and stronger, gained many friendships, and have had a found a creative outlet as result of doing jiu jitsu.  Hopefully I could convince you to give it a try.  I really believe jiu jitsu is for everyone.

    The good parts of this page is that the navigations is easily found and the page reformats itself to resizing of the window so that content appear the same large or small.  The cons of this site is that while it is nice that they have tiled all the articles and images so it would look good on mobile, it looks to busy and hard to understand the initial content on the home page.
